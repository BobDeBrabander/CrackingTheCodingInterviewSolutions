This can be done with ExternalSort.
Sort different chunks of the initial data and then merge the outputs separately.
This merging is done by taking an element from every outputfile and storing it on a maxheap/minheap.
Then we append the root to the final result output file and replace the node on the heap with the first element of the
corresponding outputfile.
