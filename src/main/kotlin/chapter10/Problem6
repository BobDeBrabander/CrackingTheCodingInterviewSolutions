This is a very big file. So it should be a very efficient algorithm.
BubbleSort and SelectionSort have terrible runtimes
MergeSort would use a lot of memory
We don't know anything about the string lengths so RadixSort is not a good option either

This leaves us with QuickSort that has a memory usage of O(log(n)). The worst case running time is O(n^2) but the average
is O(n log(n)). If we do a randomized version of the quicksort algorithm the chances of hitting the O(n^2) worst case are very small.
My choice would go to quicksort.
