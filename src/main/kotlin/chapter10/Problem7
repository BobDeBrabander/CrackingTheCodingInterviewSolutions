1GB of memory = 1 GigaByte = 1024 MegaByte = 1024 * 1024 KiloByte = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 Bytes = 1073741824 Bytes = 8589934592 bits
To represent one non-negative integer we need 31 bits

So this memory could hold 8589934592 / 31 ~ 277,094,664 integers < 4,000,000,000

So this memory is clearly not enough to keep track of all the integers given

I think what we can do is some adapted version of Radix Sort. We don't actually need to sort these integers.
First we count how many digits end on 1, 2, 3, etc. This is 10 different counters.
We write down the least common ending digit.

Then we would pass through all integers again but we keep count only of integers ending with the least common digit.
This time we count not the last digit but the last to last digit's occurrences.

We keep doing this for all digits until at any point we have 0 occurrences for a digit
we can just write this digit + the least common ending and we found our integer that doesn't occur in this set.
