Going forward with the number i from 1..100 nothing before i gets toggled anymore.
After we have done the 8th run we have
door 1 is open, door 2 is closed, door 3 is closed, door 4 is open, door 5 is closed, door 6 is open, door 7 is closed, door 8 is closed
1 = 1
2 = 1, 2
3 = 1, 3
4 = 1, 2, 4
5 = 1, 5
6 = 1, 2, 3, 6
7 = 1, 7
8 = 1, 2, 4, 8
9 = 1, 3, 9

So it seems that the real question is, how many numbers from 1 up to 100 have an odd number of divisors
I found a list of this online. You could also write some code for this who could simply calculate this.

The answer seems to be that locker 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 45, 49, 64, 81, 96, 100 are open
This is a total of 12 lockers.
