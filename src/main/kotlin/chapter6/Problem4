The probability of a collision is the probability that they would not all pick the same direction. Since if any 2 ants
pick a different direction they would eventually collide.

This is basically the same question as, what is the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on tails or heads every single time.
This is just (1/2)^3 for the starting question or (1/2)^n for the follow-up question.
