You have the first egg for the big jumps in floors and the other egg to go single steps from the last floor until it breaks.
So the question is how big should the big jumps be to balance it with the second egg.

If you make the big jump 10, then you would have at most 9 more floors to check if the first egg breaks with the second egg.
This means with 100 floors you would have at most 10 + 9 = 19 drops if the floor was set to 99.

If you make the big jump 9, then it would be 11 + 8 = 19. If the floor was set to 98
If you make the big jump 8, then you this would become 12 + 7 = 19. If the floor was set to 95
If you make the big jump 7, then it would be 14 + 7 = 21. If the floor was set to 97
If you make the big jump 11, then it would be 9 + 11 = 20. If the floor was set to 98
If you make the big jump 12, then it would be 8 + 11 = 19. If the floor was set to 95
If you make the big jump 13, then it would be 7 + 12 = 19. If the floor was set to 90


But it seems that the best thing to do is to change the big jump after being successful.
Making the big jump the first number that squared is bigger than or equal to the remaining floors to check
10 * 10 => 100 and 9*9 < 100 => First big jump 10

100 floors -> Big jump 10 -> If the egg breaks here we did 1 big jumps and have 9 more floor to check => 10
90 floors left -> big jump 10 as 9 * 9 < 90 -> If the egg breaks here we did 2 big jumps and have 9 more floor to check => 10
80 floors left -> Big jump 9 -> If the egg breaks here we did 3 big jumps and have 8 more floor to check => 12
71 floors left -> big jump 9 -> If the egg breaks here we did 4 big jumps and have 8 more floor to check => 12
62 floors left -> big jump 8 -> If the egg breaks here we did 5 big jumps and have 7 more floor to check => 12
54 floors left -> big jump 8 -> If the egg breaks here we did 6 big jumps and have 7 more floor to check => 13
46 floors left -> big jump 7 -> If the egg breaks here we did 7 big jumps and have 6 more floor to check => 13
39 floors left -> big jump 7 -> If the egg breaks here we did 8 big jumps and have 6 more floor to check => 14
32 floors left -> big jump 6 -> If the egg breaks here we did 9 big jumps and have 5 more floor to check => 14
26 floors left -> big jump 6 -> If the egg breaks here we did 10 big jumps and have 5 more floor to check => 15
20 floors left -> big jump 5 -> If the egg breaks here we did 11 big jumps and have 4 more floor to check => 15
15 floors left -> big jump 4 -> If the egg breaks here we did 12 big jumps and have 3 more floor to check => 15
11 floors left -> big jump 4 -> If the egg breaks here we did 13 big jumps and have 3 more floor to check => 16
7 floors left  -> big jump 3 -> If the egg breaks here we did 14 big jumps and have 2 more floor to check => 16
4 floors left ->  big jump 2 -> If the egg breaks here we did 15 big jumps and have 1 more floor to check => 16
2 floors left ->  big jump 2 -> If the egg breaks here we did 16 big jumps and have 1 more floor to check => 17
0 floors left

So this strategy has worst case 17. It seems that we can still do better.

If we set the big jump to some big enough number and make the big jump 1 smaller every jump then we can't do worse than the
first big jump number.
To illustrate: 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 100
This was done in 10 jumps.

Worst case it went wrong before the last eggdrop (before the jump of 1) and it would mean we would have to do a total of 15 egg drops.
1 failed drop on floor 15 + 14 single drops to find floor 14,
or 1 drop on floor 15, one failed drop on floor 39, and 13 single drops to find floor 38, etc.

14 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 100, so it seems that 14 is the first number that this works for.
