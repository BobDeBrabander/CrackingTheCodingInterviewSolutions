Map the bottle number to the binary representation
Lay the test strips out with each strip representation a bit in a 10 digit binary number
For every bottle put a drop on a test strip if that bit is set to 1 in it's binary representation

The negative strips should be 0 and the positive strips should be 1 and if you convert it back you get the number of the poison bottle
