So I am assuming each bottle of pills has at least 20 pills.

Every pill bottle gets a number 'i' from 1 upto 20.
On the scale I put 'i' pills from bottle 'i' for every pill bottle.

The scale will show the sum of 1 upto 20 + 'k' * 0.1
Where 'k' is the number of the bottle with pills of weight 1.1
To sum 1 upto 20 we have (n*(n+1))/2 = (20*(1+20)) / 2
So if we call what is on the scale 'x' then the answer is k = (x - (20*(1+20)) / 2) / 0.1
