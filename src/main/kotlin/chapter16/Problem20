This is a typical trie-tree problem.
You store all the words in a trie tree.
Then for the corresponding letters to digits you traverse the trie down. The result is all the word endings you find
after traversing all the digits.

This can be optimized further.
Instead of making the trie build on letters we can make it build on numbers. Then for every edge we take we wouldn't have a
word. We would have a sequence of digits belonging to a list of words. Then when the query comes with a list of numbers
we just have to traverse the trie and if it's a word ending return the list of words on that node.
